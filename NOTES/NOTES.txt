=> The Project is deoloyed on three parts:
1- Frontend => Vercel 
2- Backend => Render 
3- PostgreSQL Database => Neon
4- I registered for each website with my (GitHub) acount.

=> we changed the strapi sqlite database to Neon postgreSQL because render takes a long time to restart the server &
   it doesn't persist the data (it cleares the data for each restart).

=> follow the instructions from these strapi videos (Strapi Gatsby Tutorial):
-  #6 - Deploying Strapi to Render
-  #7 - Migrating to Neon Postgres Database
